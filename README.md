# Git and GitHub Assignment: Hands-On Exploration

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on exploration of Git, GitHub, and open-source practices as part of an assignment. The assignment covers various aspects including cloning, forking, branch management, conflict resolution, GitHub Pages, and contributing to open-source projects.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Cloning and Forking:**
   - Cloned a public GitHub repository related to [python and web development (CSS,Html) and javascript].
   - Forked the cloned repository to my GitHub account.

2. **Managing Branches:**
   - Created a new branch named `feature-update` in my local repository.
   - Switched to the `feature-update` branch.
   - Made changes to a file and committed them to the `feature-update` branch.

3. **Merging Changes:**
   - Switched back to the `main` branch.
   - Merged the changes from the `feature-update` branch into the `main` branch.

4. **Handling Conflicts:**
   - Created a conflict by making changes to the same file in my forked repository.
   - Resolved the conflict manually in the file.
   - Committed the changes and merged the branch back into `main`.

5. **GitHub Pages:**
   - Created a simple HTML file named `new.html`.
   - Enabled GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to `main`.

6. **Open Source Exploration:**
   - Explored an open-source project related to [python and web development (CSS,Html) and javascript].
   - Reviewed the project's documentation, issues, and contribution guidelines.
   - Attempted to open an issue but couldn't find the issues tab in the repository.

7. **Documentation and Challenges:**
   - Documented the process, commands used, and challenges faced in this README file.
   - Encountered issues while enabling GitHub Pages due to repository owner policy.

## Challenges Faced
1. Difficulty finding the issues tab in the open-source project's repository.
2. Enabling GitHub Pages was not possible due to repository owner policy.

## Resources and Assistance
- Consulted GitHub documentation for guidance on various tasks.
- Sought assistance from peers and instructor for resolving issues.

## Conclusion
This assignment provided valuable hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, and open-source practices. Despite encountering some challenges, I gained a deeper understanding of version control, collaborative development, and contributing to open-source projects.
